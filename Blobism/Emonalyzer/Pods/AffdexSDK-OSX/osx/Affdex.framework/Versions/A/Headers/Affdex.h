/**
 \mainpage
 Welcome to the Affdex SDK for iOS and macOS! With this SDK, your iOS and macOS apps will be able to detect faces and their facial expressions using the built-in camera, or via a file on your iOS device or Mac.
 
 <b>Hardware Requirements</b>
 <br>
 <ul>
 <li>iOS: Any iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch running iOS 8 or newer.</li>
 <li>macOS: A Mac running macOS 10.11 El Capitan or newer.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <b>Development Requirements</b>
 <br>
 <ul>
 <li> Xcode 8.2.1 or higher</li>
 </ul>
 
 <b>Getting Started</b>
 <br>
 To get started, visit https://github.com/Affectiva and pull down the source for one of our demo apps. Ensure that the Code Signing settings for the various projects are configured correctly. For iOS, the identity is configured for "iPhone Developer" which should match your identity automatically.
 ï¿¼
 If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please email them to sdk@affectiva.com.
 
 Enjoy the SDK!

 When an facial expression has been detected at a specific point in the video stream, this method will be called with an

 the detector was initialized.
 
 A reference to the actual image that was analyzed is passed as well. This can be useful for displaying in a view
