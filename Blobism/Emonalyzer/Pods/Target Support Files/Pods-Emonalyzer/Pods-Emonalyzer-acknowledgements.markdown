#### EXHIBIT A

**AFFDEX SDK & AFFDEX CODE**

The Affdex SDK is a software development kit that provides the ability for developers to add emotion-sensing and emotion analytics to their apps and digital experiences developed for the platform(s) specified below (“Licensee Products”). The SDK analyzes facial expressions (obtained from a camera or recorded video or images) and provides data regarding detected emotions to the user of the Licensee Product.

The Affdex Code consists of object libraries that are part of the Affdex SDK that can be incorporated into the Licensee Products that will allow developers to reproduce the functionality of Affdex within Licensee Products and allow developers to emotion-enable Licensee Products.

#### EXHIBIT B

**BRANDING REQUIREMENTS**

Licensee must comply with the following branding requirements:

Licensee shall include in the Licensee Product a “Powered by Affdex” logo (see below) (the “Affdex Logo”) placed as follows: (i) if the app displays results generated by or derived from the Affdex Code, the Affdex Logo will be shown on the display containing such results, or (ii) if the app does not display such results, the Affdex Logo should be placed in an appropriate location most closely associated with the use or invocation of the Affdex Code. The Affdex Logo must be sufficiently prominent in terms of size, duration of display, background coloring and otherwise to be easily visible and readable by the user.  Licensee will include the phrase “Emotion AI powered by Affectiva” in the description and will include Affectiva as a keyword in Licensee Product listings in application stores and websites from which Licensee Products may be downloaded by end users.
