3. Prepare!
    - Read: [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
        - Why? _This is a recent well-received popular article describing "code" for a popular audience. You will be joining the ranks of "coders" this week and I think you should have some sense of what you are getting yourself into ... and how you might want to influence the field._
    - Read: [Computer Art History](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/computer-art-history/)
        - Why? _This gives a short account of the transition from op-art / algorithmic art / minimalism to computer generated art.  We will spend a lot of time in this course looking forward and to our contemporaries, but it's important to remember we aren't the first._
    - Read: ofBook: [Forward](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html)
        - Why? _This gives a quick history of openFrameworks from [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/), one of the creators._
    - Read: ofBook [Philosophy](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/of_philosophy.html)
        - Why? _This gives an articulate description of the design goals of openFrameworks and the DIWO culture that we attempt to model in this course._
    - Read: ofBook [C++ Language Basics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html)
        - Why? _These are the basics of our langauge that you'll come back to again and again. We will be going over this in week 2 so a head start will make week two go much more smoothly and hopefully you'll remember more._
    - Read: ofBook [ofSketch](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/ofSketch.html)
        - Why? _ofSketch is the software we'll be using to develop openFrameworks code. We'll be going into this in more depth in week two and [the more you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3rhQc666Sg) the better._
4. Watch:
    - Watch at least one of these videos [https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos).
        - Why: _The presenters at [Eyeo Festival](http://eyeofestival.com/) and [INST-INT](http://inst-int.com/) are very influential in the field of Interactive Art / Creative Code.  Pay attention to them, but try not to be overwhelmed._
