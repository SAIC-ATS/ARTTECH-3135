1. Install!
    - Git: (follow the instructions for your platform here: [http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads))
    - Xcode: Get it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and install it. It may take a while.  It's 20800000000 bits large.
2. Sign up!
	- Sign up for [http://github.com](http://github.com).  Just get a free account.
    - Check out the [backpack](https://education.github.com/pack)!
	- Sign up for an account at [http://talk.olab.io](http://talk.olab.io).
  - Sign up for an account at [http://ats.community](http://ats.community).
3. Prepare!
    - Read: [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) [a longer read]
        - Why? _This is a recent well-received popular article describing "code" for a popular audience. You will be joining the ranks of "coders" this week and I think you should have some sense of what you are getting yourself into ... and how you might want to influence the field._
    - Read: [Computer Art History](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/computer-art-history/) [a short read]
        - Why? _This gives a short account of the transition from op-art / algorithmic art / minimalism to computer generated art.  We will spend a lot of time in this course looking forward and to our contemporaries, but it's important to remember we aren't the first._
    - Read: ofBook: [a short read] [Forward](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html)
        - Why? _This gives a quick history of openFrameworks from [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/), one of the creators._
    - Read: ofBook [a short read] [Philosophy](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/of_philosophy.html)
        - Why? _This gives an articulate description of the design goals of openFrameworks and the DIWO culture that we attempt to model in this course._
    - Read: ofBook [C++ Language Basics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html) [*a must read*]
        - Why? _These are the basics of our language that you'll come back to again and again. We will be going over this in week 2 so a head start will make week two go much more smoothly and hopefully you'll remember more._
5. Code Project: [*required*]
    - Artist Sol Lewitt (1928-2007) is well-known for creating algorithmic drawings that exist as sets of instructions, rather than as a finalized, rendered piece.
    - For example:
    >   _Wall Drawing #327_
    >
    On a black wall, a white trapezoid within which are white vertical parallel lines and a white square within which are white horizontal parallel lines. The vertical lines within the trapezoid do not enter the square, and the horizontal lines within the square do not enter the trapezoid.
    >
    >   _Wall Drawing #328_
    >
    On a black wall, a white circle within which are white vertical parallel lines, and a white parallelogram within which are white horizontal parallel lines. The vertical lines within the circle do not enter the parallelogram, and the horizontal lines within the parallelogram do not enter the circle.
    >
    - Online, you will find other people's renderings based on these instructions, but I encourage you to avoid the urge to google them and interpret them for yourself and your limited toolset.
    - So, your job is to *render at least one of the above instructions* using openFrameworks.  Consider using combinations of `ofDrawLine`, `ofDrawRectangle`, `ofDrawCircle`.
    - For added challenge, try to do it using as few lines of code as possible (hint, consider using [for-loops](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_for_loop.htm) to create repetitions )

4. Watch: [optional, but you won't regret it]
    - Watch at least one of these videos [https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos).
        - Why: _The presenters at [Eyeo Festival](http://eyeofestival.com/) and [INST-INT](http://inst-int.com/) are very influential in the field of Interactive Art / Creative Code.  Pay attention to them, but try not to be overwhelmed._
