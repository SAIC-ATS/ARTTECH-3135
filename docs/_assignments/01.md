1. Read!
    - Read: ofBook: [Graphics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html)
        - Why? _You have to know how to draw!_
        - Become familiar with:
          - `ofPath`
            - some [documentation](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofPath/)
            - an [example](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/graphics/polygonExample)

3. Learn about "Git" and "Github"
  - Why? _Git is a tool that you'll use all the time in this class and in your future lives as Creative Coders. It's by far the most popular way to share and manage code and should become a bit like breathing as you develop code._
    - If you learn by **reading**, consider this: [Version Control with Git](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/version_control_with_git.html)
    - If you learn best by **watching videos**, check out [Up and Running with Git and GitHub](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Up-Running-Git-GitHub/409275-2.html) (about 1.25 hours).
      - _Remember that you have "free" access to Lynda.com through SAIC. Go [here](http://www.saic.edu/academics/computing/lyndaonlinesoftwaretraining/) to log in._

4. Review!
    - Check out my [Assignment 00 solutions](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3135/tree/master/Assignment_00).
      - _Remember, these are just a few different ways.  I'm assuming you also know that as artists, using "brute-force" (i.e. manually entering each and every line) was also a valid option._
    - Review [Week 00 examples](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3135/tree/master/Week_00).
    - Do you know what the following terms mean?
      - _Iterating with a for-loop_ ([hint](https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/Iterating/182674/366536-4.html))
      - _Range-based for-loop_ ([hint](https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/Using-range-based-loop/182674/366537-4.html))
      - _Conditional statements `if`, `then`, `else`, `else if`_ ([hint](https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/Conditionals/182674/366533-4.html))
      - _Variable "scope"_ ([hint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz_W4wlP-cg) and [hint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_variable_scope.htm))
