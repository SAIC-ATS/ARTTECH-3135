1. Create an Interactive Experimental Drawing Application
    - An experimental drawing application **should** ...
      - ... allow users / participants to "draw" using the mouse.
      - ... allow users / participants to affect the "drawing" using the keyboard.
      - ... allow the user to clear the screen using a keyboard command.
    - An experimental drawing application **should not** ...
      - ... attempt to do all of the things that existing drawing applications (e.g. Photoshop) already do.
      - ... make excessive use of `ofRandom` ... (ok, that's just my preference, it's not required).
      - ... take more than a few hours to build.
    - Take several screen shots of your best "drawing" and submit them with your code (**we will talk about how to do this next week**. Hold on to your code and screenshots for now).
