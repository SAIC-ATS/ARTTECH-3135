1. Read!
    - Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)
        - Why? _This gives an overview of the important concept of Object Oriented Programming. We'll be covering this in class._
    - Prepare for next week.  We will be talking about:
        - Classes and Objects - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm) is recommended.
        - Inheritance - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_inheritance.htm) is recommended.
        - Function Overloading - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_overloading.htm) is recommended.
        - Polymorphism - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_polymorphism.htm) is recommended.
        - Abstraction - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_abstraction.htm) is recommended.
        - Encapsulation - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_encapsulation.htm) is recommended.
        - Interfaces - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_interfaces.htm) is recommended.
        - If you'd prefer a video tutorial over text tutorials, I'd recommend the Lynda.com tutorials [here](http://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/C-Essential-Training/182674-2.html), specifically section 4 _Classes and Objects_.  In fact, I'd highly recommend the whole video course if you're feeling a little behind or need a bigger picture.
2. Code
    - **Section 002**
        - Create a custom class (e.g. cake, butterfly, insect, car, etc).
            - Building from the custom class,
            - Add at least 4 "features" to class (e.g. if you were making a face, _Hair_, _Ears_, etc).
            - Add any variables needed to render the features to the class (e.g. `ofColor hairColor;`).
            - Determine how you will render the feature with simple shapes (e.g. using `ofDrawRectangle`, `ofDrawEllipse`, etc).
            - Create a grid of 16 instances of your class, making each instance as unique as possible by setting unique values for each instance.
        - Using the `AnimatedFace` code as a guide update your class to include at two animated components.
    - **Section 001**
      - Building from the [Animated Face](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3135/tree/master/Session_04) examples, create the following modifications:
          - Program 1: Adding new features to the `Face` class.
              - Add 2 additional "features" to Face (e.g. _Hair_, _Ears_, etc).
              - Add any variables needed to render the new feature to the `Face` class (e.g. `ofColor hairColor;`).
              - Determine how you will render the feature with simple shapes (e.g. using `ofDrawRectangle`, `ofDrawEllipse`, etc).
              - Create a grid of 16 faces, making each instance as unique as possible by setting unique values for each instance.
          - Program 2: Adding animated features to your unique `Face` class  
              - Add the ability to uniquely animate each of the features that you added in Program 1.
              - Create grid of faces that all look different and have unique movements by setting unique values for each instance parameters.
      - Design a new _class_ that tries to capture the important features of a toy ball.
          - With this `Ball` class we need to
              - Draw the ball on the screen.
              - Control its position.
              - Cause the ball to bounce off the side of the screen.
              - Create a variety of sizes and colors.
          - List the features of the ball that you will need and express those features as variables (e.g. `float ballRadius;`)
          - List the functions of the ball (e.g. `void bounce();`)
      - Using the `AnimatedFace` code as a guide create a `Ball` class and implement it in your own `Ball.h` and `Ball.cpp`.
      - Stretch goal ... create a set of animated balls using your `Ball` class.

3. Review
    - What is a `class`?
    - How does a `class` differ from an _instance_ of a class?
    - What is a class constructor function?
    - What is a class destructor function?
