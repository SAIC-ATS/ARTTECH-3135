1. Read!
    - Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)
        - Why? _This gives an overview of the important concept of Object Oriented Programming. We'll be covering this in class._
    - Prepare for next week.  We will be talking about:
        - Classes and Objects - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm) is recommended.
        - Inheritance - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_inheritance.htm) is recommended.
        - Function Overloading - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_overloading.htm) is recommended.
        - Polymorphism - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_polymorphism.htm) is recommended.
        - Abstraction - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_abstraction.htm) is recommended.
        - Encapsulation - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_encapsulation.htm) is recommended.
        - Interfaces - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_interfaces.htm) is recommended.
        - If you'd prefer a video tutorial over text tutorials, I'd recommend the Lynda.com tutorials [here](http://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/C-Essential-Training/182674-2.html), specifically section 4 _Classes and Objects_.  In fact, I'd highly recommend the whole video course if you're feeling a little behind or need a bigger picture.
2. Code
     - Create a custom class (e.g. cake, butterfly, insect, car, etc).
         - Building from the custom class,
         - Add at least 4 "features" to class (e.g. if you were making a face, _Hair_, _Ears_, etc).
         - Add any variables needed to render the features to the class (e.g. `ofColor hairColor;`).
         - Determine how you will render the feature with simple shapes (e.g. using `ofDrawRectangle`, `ofDrawEllipse`, etc).
         - Create a grid of 16 instances of your class, making each instance as unique as possible by setting unique values for each instance.
     - Using the `AnimatedFace` code as a guide update your class to include at two animated components.

3. Review
    - What is a `class`?
    - How does a `class` differ from an _instance_ of a class?
    - What is a class constructor function?
    - What is a class destructor function?
