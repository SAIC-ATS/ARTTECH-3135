1. Read!
    - Read: ofBook [Sound](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/sound.html)
    - Read: ofBook [Image Processing and Computer Vision](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html)
2. Code
   - Natural Phenomena: Choose a natural phenomena, such as "fire, explosions, smoke, moving water (such as a waterfall), sparks, falling leaves, rock falls, clouds, fog, snow, dust, meteor tails, stars and galaxies ..." ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system)) and reproduce it as realistically as you can.
      - Create custom classes as needed.
      - One of your particle classes should demonstrate the ability to attach media such as a video, texture, 3d object, sound, etc.
      - References for particle system parameters (some are not in C++, but the concepts are the same):
