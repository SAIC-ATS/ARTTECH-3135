1. Read!
    - Read: ofBook [Sound](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/sound.html)
1. Code
  - Natural Phenomena: Choose a natural phenomena, such as "fire, explosions, smoke, moving water (such as a waterfall), sparks, falling leaves, rock falls, clouds, fog, snow, dust, meteor tails, stars and galaxies ..." ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system)) and reproduce it as realistically as you can.
      - Extend our in class particle system to include a "Force".  This "force" is a small vector that is added to the acceleration every time e.g.
      ```
      acceleration += force; // Add the force.
      force = { 0, 0, 0 }; // Reset the force.
      ```
      - Create custom classes as needed.
      - One of your particle classes should demonstrate the ability to attach media such as a video, texture, 3d object, etc.
      - You must also incorporate sound.  This might be a background track or it could be a sound associated with each particle.  See the `examples/sound` for tips.
      - Hint: Consider working together and give yourself some time!
      - References for particle system parameters (some are not in C++, but the concepts are the same):

          - [Pictures for Inspiration](https://www.google.com/search?q=particle+system+examples&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=757&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CEEQsARqFQoTCOCC1LCGo8gCFUeKDQodcWUCww)
      - Wrap your experiment from above into a class called `ParticleSystem` that implements the following interface:

      ```c++

      class ParticleSystem
      {
      public:
        // This function will set up the particle system.
        void setup();
        // This function will draw the particle system.
        void draw();
        // This function will update each particle in the particle system.
        void update();

        // This will add a new individual particle to the system.
        void addParticle();

        // This will remove all of the particles from the system.
        void clearParticles();

        // This is the vector where you will store the new particles.
        std::vector<Particle> particles;

      };
      ```

      - Then create a new application that instantiates two or more particle systems using the `ParticleSystem` class.

      ```c++

      class ofApp: public ofBaseApp {
      public:
        void setup();
        void update();
        void draw();

        void keyPressed(int key);

        ParticleSystem myParticleSystem;
        ParticleSystem myOtherParticleSystem;

      };

      ```

      and

      ```c++
      ofApp::setup()
      {
        myParticleSystem.setup();
        myOtherParticleSystem.setup();
      }

      ofApp::update()
      {
        myParticleSystem.update();
        myOtherParticleSystem.update();
      }

      
      ofApp::draw()
      {
        myParticleSystem.draw();
        myOtherParticleSystem.draw();
      }


      ofApp::keyPressed(int key)
      {
        if (key == 'm')
        {
          myParticleSystem.addParticle();
        }
        else if (key == 'k')
        {
          myOtherParticleSystem.addParticle();
        }
        else if (key == 'c')
        {
          myParticleSystem.clear();
          myOtherParticleSystem.clear();
        }
      }
      ```
