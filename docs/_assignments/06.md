1. Check out the following artists for mirror inspiration!
   - [Daniel Rozin](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/)
   - [The Khronos Projector](http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/alvaro/Khronos/)
   - [All sorts of mirrors!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6C1909B96FB79A2A)
   - [Pom Pom Mirror](https://vimeo.com/128375543)

2. Coding!
   - Create an animated "mirror" that runs on its own, or with minimal user interaction (mouse, etc).
   - First, explore the example code I provided, particularly [examples 07 - 12](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3135/tree/master/Session_06).  Take the time to look at _all_ of them and try to understand what the parameters control.
   - With PEN / PAPER, design your mirror. Sketch out your ideas, and explain them in words to someone (snap a photo of your sketches to turn in when the time comes)
   - Once you have a pretty clear idea what direction you want to go, pick one of the [examples 7 - 12](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3135/tree/master/Session_06) and start building.
   - We will set up all of the mirrors at the beginning of next class and do a mini-critique, tour of all mirrors in class.
   - Please keep your code and your sketches as documentation for submission when the time comes.
