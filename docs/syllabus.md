### Reading and other Resources

Posted on the course website.

### Materials

Provided by the student as needed.

### ATS Facilities

Normal ATS facilities access, procedures and policies have changed significantly in response to COVID-19 pandemic.  Please familiarize yourself with ATS facilities availability, capacity, authorizations, reservations, sanitation and other ATS-specific information in the [ATS Facilities Canvas Course](https://saic.instructure.com/enroll/CMMJY3).

### ATS Community

ATS is working to build a strong online and offline community during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly encourage all ATS students to sign up for our departmental forum at [https://ats.community](https://ats.community). Students can find out about visiting artist opportunities, upcoming ATS Town Halls, our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion reading group, special events, participate in discussions, and get help with their projects.

### Community in the time of Covid

We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. We also recognize that in these unprecedented times each of our relationships to art and education are being asked to change in profound and fundamental ways. This course will not ignore the complexities of how the pandemic, current events, and society's evolving practices in health and safety are influencing our daily abilities to learn and engage.

To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit and recognize the many valid and varying experiences that shape the way we inhabit and express ourselves within this classroom. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Each student is expected to practice agency in defining their own learning objectives with this course material and contribute to building a supportive environment for others to define and achieve their own learning objectives. Students are also expected to practice self-care- understanding that each of our learning happens differently as the circumstances of our lives fluctuate. Be patient with yourself and be mindful of what your health and body need in an online learning environment to best achieve your goals.  Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, in lieu of defensiveness; this class will work to instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

### General Classroom Health and Safety Expectations

- Masks must be worn at all times in classrooms and campus buildings (except when eating in designated spaces)
- Maintain 6 feet (or more) of distance from everyone as much as possible
- When it is necessary to be within 6 feet of someone, it should be for less than 15 minutes cumulatively over the course of a day.

It is essential to adhere to these guidelines to lower the risk of Covid19 infection for everyone in the SAIC community.

If you follow these rules, you will not be considered a "contact" even if someone in your class tests positive or develops symptoms of Covid19.  

If you do not follow these rules and someone with whom you have been in extended close contact (under 6 feet for more than 15 minutes cumulatively in one day) tests positive or develops symptoms of Covid19, you will automatically be considered a "contact" and will have to quarantine for 14 days.  This does not mean that you will develop Covid19, but it does mean that you will have to remain in quarantine for 14 days, regardless of whether or not you test positive for Covid19 or develop symptoms.

If you feel ill, have a temperature, or develop symptoms of Covid19, stay home , call the Wellness Center, and contact your instructor for a makeup assignment. Do not return to campus until you have been advised it is OK to do so by the Wellness Center. Health Services: healthservices@saic.edu and 312-499-4288.

Visit the Make Ready framework (Links to an external site.) website for more information about our community effort to be safe and minimize the spread of illness on campus this semester.

### Attendance, Participation, and Engagement Policy

Faculty will excuse any absence from in-person course activity when a student is ill, has any symptoms of illness, or is engaging in a precautionary quarantine. Instead, faculty will issue students alternative assignments or activities to stand in for any in-person content that is missed. To the extent that their health permits, students should continue keeping up with online course activity and independent work while they are studying remotely. The complete attendance policy for 2020-2021 can be found in the SAIC Student Handbook: https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf#page=73

### Wait Lists

Students wait-listed for classes will be admitted on a space available basis determined by instructor’s discretion (in consultation with the department chair).

### Grading Procedure/Criteria

- Grades are credit / no-credit for this course. Credit is based on several factors: 30% participation (discussions, critiques, etc), 70% projects / assignments.
- All assignments must be completed and submitted as instructed.
- Incomplete grades will not be offered.

### Writing Assistance

[Writing Center](https://www.saic.edu/academics/writing-center)

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented. You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.

- How to Upload Pong Examples to Private Repo
- Object Oriented Programming.  
- OOP vs Structured Programming
  - C++ is often described as C + object oriented code.
  - Structured → top down approach
  - OOP → create models problem
  - Why OOP?
    - Duplicate code can be confusing and lead to bug if it is modified in the future. You will always forget something!
    - Modeling the world using objects can often be more intuitive, better differentiating between form and function.
  - Classes
    - Classes are user defined data structures.
    - Classes are reusable between programs.
    - Classes are a way to aggregate or model form (attributes) and function (methods) into reusable units.
    - Classes are often used to easily represent multiples of a complex object.
    - Classes are "extensible" through inheritance.
    - An class "instance" is an independent "instantiated" variable form of a class.
    - In the same way that an `int` is a variable type and it is instantiated by calling `int i = 0;`, a class variable type like `Ball ball1;`  Now the `ball1` variable is its own "instance" that can be manipulated.  Other "instances" e.g. `Ball ball2;` will have the same capabilities as `ball1`, but it will behave independently by default.
    - Example: Writing a class definition for a ball.
      - What are the "attributes" (that can be represented as variables) of a ball?
        - Position
        - Velocity
        - Color
        - ...
      - What are the "actions" associated with a human?
        - update
        - draw
    - Create default instances like you would with other variables.
    - Create custom instances by defining custom constructors.
    - Dot operator give you access to "member" attributes within a class.
  - Warnings:
    - Don't try to model the world!
    - Design your classes and represent only salient attributes and actions that you need for your project.
    - OOP isn't the solution to everything.  Most advanced programs are a combination of functional and object oriented approaches.
- Particle System Examples
  - Replace ball variables with a Ball class.
  - Replace x / y / z variables with `ofPoint` (which is an alias for `ofVec3f` or in 0.10.0+ `glm::vec3`).
    - `ofPoint` is a "vector" of values, x, y, z and vector math can be performed in one line.
    - `ofPoint` is a class!
  - Particle systems in 3D!
- Arrays are collections of variables.
  - In C++ we usually use a `std::vector` to hold a collection of variables.
  - We must define the contents of the `std::vector` using a template argument like `std::vector<int>` for a collection of integers.
