### Course Description

This studio course investigates the creative possibilities in programming, from interactivity to information visualization. Students explore interactive narratives and games, software art, simulations and emergent behaviors, and other code-based forms. Lectures, discussions, and demonstrations provide a conceptual, aesthetic and technical foundation in programming as a creative practice.

### Course Goals

__Key goals include:__

- Intermediate working knowledge of creative coding tools and techniques.
- Working knowledge of the landscape of contemporary open source coding tools.
- Working knowledge of coding tools such as Git, Xcode, Terminal, etc.
- Working knowledge of contemporary artists and groups that shape the fields of interactive art and creative code.

### Course Values

- Sharing / Open
  - Documentation

### Methodology

Students will engage in individual in-lab and home assignments, class presentations, lectures, discussions, assigned readings, group and individual projects and desk critiques.  Visiting artists / faculty may enhance the experience and offer additional perspectives.

### Assignments

The course may include workshops and several projects, relevant technical and theoretical reading, written online responses, technical research and outings.

- How to Upload Pong Examples to Private Repo
- Object Oriented Programming.  
- OOP vs Structured Programming
  - C++ is often described as C + object oriented code.
  - Structured → top down approach
  - OOP → create models problem
  - Why OOP?
    - Duplicate code can be confusing and lead to bug if it is modified in the future. You will always forget something!
    - Modeling the world using objects can often be more intuitive, better differentiating between form and function.
  - Classes
    - Classes are user defined data structures.
    - Classes are reusable between programs.
    - Classes are a way to aggregate or model form (attributes) and function (methods) into reusable units.
    - Classes are often used to easily represent multiples of a complex object.
    - Classes are "extensible" through inheritance.
    - An class "instance" is an independent "instantiated" variable form of a class.
    - In the same way that an `int` is a variable type and it is instantiated by calling `int i = 0;`, a class variable type like `Ball ball1;`  Now the `ball1` variable is its own "instance" that can be manipulated.  Other "instances" e.g. `Ball ball2;` will have the same capabilities as `ball1`, but it will behave independently by default.
    - Example: Writing a class definition for a ball.
      - What are the "attributes" (that can be represented as variables) of a ball?
        - Position
        - Velocity
        - Color
        - ...
      - What are the "actions" associated with a human?
        - update
        - draw
    - Create default instances like you would with other variables.
    - Create custom instances by defining custom constructors.
    - Dot operator give you access to "member" attributes within a class.
  - Warnings:
    - Don't try to model the world!
    - Design your classes and represent only salient attributes and actions that you need for your project.
    - OOP isn't the solution to everything.  Most advanced programs are a combination of functional and object oriented approaches.
- Particle System Examples
  - Replace ball variables with a Ball class.
  - Replace x / y / z variables with `ofPoint` (which is an alias for `ofVec3f` or in 0.10.0+ `glm::vec3`).
    - `ofPoint` is a "vector" of values, x, y, z and vector math can be performed in one line.
    - `ofPoint` is a class!
  - Particle systems in 3D!
- Arrays are collections of variables.
  - In C++ we usually use a `std::vector` to hold a collection of variables.
  - We must define the contents of the `std::vector` using a template argument like `std::vector<int>` for a collection of integers.
